            I am looking for an opportunity to learn and grow with an awesome team, 
            I have meddle with the MERN stack, written Node with SQL DBMS like postgress
            too  and I work mostly with Ruby on rails in recent times, but I am also excited to 
            learn new technologies and contribute to the overall progress of my team.
        </p>
