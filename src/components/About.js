            Hi, once again my name is Raphael Noriode and I really love to add value at scale,
            I am a lover of technology and communities and I belong to a few of them, like you can see from the 
            attached picture, I was giving a talk at a developers circle event in my local community. Okay enough of community talks<br/>
            I have a Diploma in computer science and on the verge of getting a Bachelors in a few years (to be updated) 
            I make things and break them with tools like Ruby on rails, Javascript, React and some not so fancy technologies 
            that mere mortals would run away from :smile:
            I write codes at <a href="https://www.crowdfrica.org/">Crowdfrica</a> where I tend to fix the lives of less-priviledge kids in Africa through codes
            and I also work part-time as a Technical support engineer at <a href="https://www.microverse.org/">Microverse</a> a fun coding school which I attended for a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a community lover, I am a Microsoft student partner and the Lead Ingressive ambassador at the University
            of Uyo, Nigeria.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not coding, I am reading, apprendre le fran√ßais, playing video games or singing
          </p>
          <p>Please stick around for more ..............:smiles:</p>
